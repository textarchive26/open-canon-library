<p>
This library provides free public access to early Christian writings, related canonical traditions, and documented historical timelines.
</p>

<p>
Different communities preserved different collections of texts throughout history. Some became widely recognized in the West. Others were preserved regionally. Some were lost and rediscovered centuries later.
</p>

<p>
This project gathers them into one organized space so readers may encounter primary texts directly.
